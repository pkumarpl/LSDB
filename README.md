# LSDB
Program reads PLATON, SHELX INS file, XD MASTER and PARAMETER files, or AIM2TAB output file and tries to figure out the local coordinate system
for each atom based on connectivity and geometrical parameters. The defined local axes can be visualized in PLATON (at least the UNIX 
version of PLATON). In addition it provides an interface to PAULINA DOMINIAK LAB pseudoatom databank so that pseudoatom parameters can automatically be assigned to atoms in  
the structure.
